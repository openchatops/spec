# OpenChatOps Specification

**OpenChatOps** is a protocol and set of APIs for programming language agnostic chat bots. An OCO-compliant chat bot is a program that serves as a central communications hub for a number of user-authored plugins. The plugins are responsible for connecting the bot to a chat service over a network and for providing various functionality to the bot by responding to incoming messages from users in the chat service.

This repository contains the OpenChatOps specification, which details the communication protocol and the the APIs that a chat bot must provide to support OpenChatOps plugins, as well as the details of plugin authoring and operation.

OpenChatOps is in a very early stage of development. Partcipation in the form of ideas and discussion is highly encouraged.
